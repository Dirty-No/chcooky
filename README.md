# Get chrome cookies.

This tool is for getting chrome and other likely browser cookies(eg. 360chrome, qqbrowser), while these saved in the 
[Cookies] sqlite database are encrypted.

In default, chrome program path and data path has been set up according to running system.
you can run it without no parameters, especially in OSX.

But if error occured, it seems that you should specify `--chrome` and `--data` parameters manually.

(Please eat with `EditThisCookie` extension.)
